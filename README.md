# Project Overview
---

## Objective


The goal of this project is to develop a **multi-agent decision-making framework** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for financial asset selection.
Each agent represents a distinct investment philosophy and evaluates market information through its own lens.
The system aims to explore whether heterogeneous agent reasoning can generate more robust and explainable investment decisions.

## Methodology

**Multi-Agent Architecture**

The system consists of several autonomous LLM-based agents, each guided by a different decision rule:

- Conservative Agent – emphasizes stability, low volatility, and predictable returns.

- Risk-Seeking Agent – prioritizes momentum and high-growth potential.

- Rational Agent – integrates return–risk trade-offs and diversification considerations.

- Sentiment Agent – interprets sentiment indicators derived from price behavior.
